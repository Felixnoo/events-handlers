# OpenFunction events handlers

This repo is used to store the code for the events handlers in the OpenFunction event framework.

We provide two types of event handlers, one for events fetched from the event source (eventsource handler) and one for events fetched from the event bus (trigger handler).

The reason for making event handlers standalone repo's is that they can be made to work as OpenFunction functions.
